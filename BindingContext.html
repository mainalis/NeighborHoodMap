1. The knockout maintains a parent/child hierarchy of contexts.
2. every thing is relative to the context we are in.
3. The root context is ViewModel that was supplied to the ko.applyBindings function.

type of context explanation

$root
    it is useful to access the root context in any child context and can be useful to know how many parent/child contexts
    are above the one you are currenty in.

$parent
    this context is used to access the direct parent context's from the childeren context

$parents
    similar to the "$parent", it contains the array of the parent contexts to the context yor are currently in.

$data
    it provides access to the current object your context is in.
$index
    this is only available with in foreach binding and contains an integer that represents the current
    position of the loop starting o and going to the length -1
